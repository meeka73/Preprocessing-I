        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>I believe that my experience with technology, specifically in the web design, make me the best match for the position. In my previous job, I was responsible for maintaining and updating our company website. This required keeping employee profiles updated and continuously posting information regarding upcoming events. I truly enjoyed what I was doing, which is what drew me to this position with your company. I would love to bring the coding and content skills I learned there to this position.</p>
